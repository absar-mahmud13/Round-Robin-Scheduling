# Round Robin Scheduling Simulator

This repository contains a Python simulation of the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm, which is widely used in CPU process scheduling. The project showcases how to calculate waiting time, turnaround time, and visualize the scheduling order using a Gantt chart.

## Features

- Simulates the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.
- Calculates:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting and Turnaround Times
- Generates a Gantt chart to visualize the scheduling order.
- Accepts customizable inputs for:
  - Process IDs
  - Burst Times
  - Arrival Times
  - Time Quantum

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `matplotlib` (for Gantt chart visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Round-Robin-Scheduling-Simulator.git
   cd Round-Robin-Scheduling-Simulator
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python Round_Robin_Scheduling.py
   ```
4. Check the outputs in the `output/` directory.

## Sample Input

```
Process ID       Burst Time     Arrival Time
P1                    10             0
P2                    5              1
P3                    8              2

Time Quantum: 3
```

## Sample Output and Gantt Chart:

- **Waiting Time:** P1: 13 ms, P2: 8 ms, P3: 12 ms
- **Turnaround Time:** P1: 23 ms, P2: 13 ms, P3: 20 ms
- **Average Waiting Time:** 11.00 ms
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 18.67 ms
- **P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P1 -> P3**
